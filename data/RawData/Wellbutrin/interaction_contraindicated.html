<li>eliglustat<p>bupropion increases levels of eliglustat by affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 metabolism. Contraindicated. If coadministered with strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors, reduce eliglustat dose from 84 mg BID to 84 mg once daily in extensive  and intermediate metabolizers;  eliglustat is contraindiated if strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors are given concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors.</p></li><li>isocarboxazid<p>isocarboxazid and bupropion both increase  dopaminergic effects. Contraindicated. Bupropion inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (NE), and MAOIs decrease metabolism of dopamine and NE; coadministration increases risk for hypertensive reactions; allow at least 14 days between discontinuation of MAOI and initiating bupropion</p></li><li>phenelzine<p>phenelzine and bupropion both increase  dopaminergic effects. Contraindicated. Bupropion inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (NE), and MAOIs decrease metabolism of dopamine and NE; coadministration increases risk for hypertensive reactions; allow at least 14 days between discontinuation of MAOI and initiating bupropion</p></li><li>pimozide<p>bupropion will increase the level or effect of pimozide by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 metabolism. Contraindicated. Both bupropion and hydroxybupropion (major metabolite) are considered strong CYP2D6 inhibitors; additionally, bupropion and pimozide lower seizure threshold</p></li><li>rasagiline<p>rasagiline and bupropion both increase  dopaminergic effects. Contraindicated. Bupropion inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (NE), and MAOIs decrease metabolism of dopamine and NE; coadministration increases risk for hypertensive reactions; allow at least 14 days between discontinuation of MAOI and initiating bupropion</p></li><li>selegiline<p>selegiline and bupropion both increase  dopaminergic effects. Contraindicated. Bupropion inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (NE), and MAOIs decrease metabolism of dopamine and NE; coadministration increases risk for hypertensive reactions; allow at least 14 days between discontinuation of MAOI and initiating bupropion</p></li><li>selegiline transdermal<p>selegiline transdermal and bupropion both increase  dopaminergic effects. Contraindicated. Bupropion inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (NE), and MAOIs decrease metabolism of dopamine and NE; coadministration increases risk for hypertensive reactions; allow at least 14 days between discontinuation of MAOI and initiating bupropion</p></li><li>tranylcypromine<p>tranylcypromine and bupropion both increase  dopaminergic effects. Contraindicated. Bupropion inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (NE), and MAOIs decrease metabolism of dopamine and NE; coadministration increases risk for hypertensive reactions; allow at least 14 days between discontinuation of MAOI and initiating bupropion</p></li>
