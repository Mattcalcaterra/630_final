<li>cabergoline<p>isosorbide dinitrate increases effects of cabergoline by decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of increased SBP, angina pectoris.</p></li><li>ergoloid mesylates<p>isosorbide dinitrate increases effects of ergoloid mesylates by decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of increased SBP, angina pectoris.</p></li><li>ergonovine<p>isosorbide dinitrate increases effects of ergonovine by decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of increased SBP, angina pectoris.</p></li><li>ergotamine<p>isosorbide dinitrate increases effects of ergotamine by decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of increased SBP, angina pectoris.</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of isosorbide dinitrate by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of isosorbide dinitrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to 3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>methylergonovine<p>isosorbide dinitrate increases effects of methylergonovine by decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of increased SBP, angina pectoris.</p></li>
