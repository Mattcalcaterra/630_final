Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Increased risk of rhabdomyolysis (incl a fatality).</p></li><li>cyclosporine<p>cyclosporine increases toxicity of pravastatin by Other (see comment). Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. 
Comment: OATP1B1 inhibitors may increase risk of myopathy.</p></li><li>eltrombopag<p>eltrombopag increases toxicity of pravastatin by Other (see comment). Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. 
Comment: OATP1B1 inhibitors may increase risk of myopathy.</p></li><li>eluxadoline<p>pravastatin increases levels of eluxadoline by decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Decrease eluxadoline dose to 75 mg PO BID if coadministered with OATP1B1 inhibitors. .</p></li><li>fenofibrate<p>fenofibrate, pravastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>fenofibrate micronized<p>fenofibrate micronized, pravastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>fenofibric acid<p>fenofibric acid, pravastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>gemfibrozil<p>gemfibrozil, pravastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Gemfibrozil may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of pravastatin by P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit P-gp, may significantly increase systemic exposure to P-gp substrates.</p></li><li>niacin<p>niacin, pravastatin.
Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Increased risk of rhabdomyolysis (&gt;1 g/day niacin).</p></li>
