<li>erlotinib<p>pantoprazole decreases levels of erlotinib by Other (see comment). Contraindicated. 
Comment: Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors with erlotinib should be avoided if possible. Drugs that alter pH of upper GI tract may alter the solubility of erlotinib and reduce its bioavailability. .</p></li><li>nelfinavir<p>pantoprazole decreases levels of nelfinavir by unspecified interaction mechanism. Contraindicated. Coadministration may lead to loss of nelfinavir virologic response and development of resistance; mechanism may be CYP2C19 inhibition of nelfinavir conversion to active M8 metabolite, and also PPIs decreasing gastric pH resulting in decreased nelfinavir absorption.</p></li><li>rilpivirine<p>pantoprazole decreases levels of rilpivirine by increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Contraindicated. Contraindicated. Concurrent use may cause treatment failure and/or the development of rilpivirine or NNRTI resistance. Coadministration of a PPI and rilpivirine may result in decreased rilpivirine plasma concentrations, which could cause impaired virologic response to rilpivirine.</p></li>
