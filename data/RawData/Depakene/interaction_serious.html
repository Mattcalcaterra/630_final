Either increases levels of the other by Mechanism: plasma protein binding competition. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>sodium oxybate<p>valproic acid increases levels of sodium oxybate by Other (see comment). Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. 
Comment: If stabilized on sodium oxybate, decrease nightly dose by at least 20% when starting valproic acid; if already taking valproic acid, use a lower starting sodium oxybate dose; monitor dose and adjust dose accordingly.</p></li><li>sodium phenylacetate<p>valproic acid decreases effects of sodium phenylacetate by pharmacodynamic antagonism.
