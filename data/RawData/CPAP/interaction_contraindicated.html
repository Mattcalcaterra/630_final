Contraindicated. Avoid coadministration. Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease cobimetinib systemic exposure by &gt;80% and reduce its efficacy.</p></li><li>dienogest/estradiol valerate<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of dienogest/estradiol valerate by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Women should not choose estradiol valerate/dienogest as their contraceptive while using strong CYP3A4 inducers due to potential decrease in contraceptive efficacy. Estradiol valerate/dienogest should not be used for at least 28 days after discontinuation of the inducer due to  possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy.  </p></li><li>elbasvir/grazoprevir<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of elbasvir/grazoprevir by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. The therapeutic effect of elbasvir/grazoprevir may be reduced if coadministered with strong CYP3A inducers and is therefore contraindicated.</p></li><li>elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir df<p>dexamethasone decreases levels of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir df by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance.</p></li><li>lumacaftor/ivacaftor<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of lumacaftor/ivacaftor by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Strong CYP3A inducers have minimal effect on lumacaftor exposure, but decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by 57%. This may reduce the effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Therefore, coadministration is not recommended.</p></li><li>lumefantrine<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of lumefantrine by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers can result in decreased serum concentrations and loss of antimalarial efficacy</p></li><li>lurasidone<p>dexamethasone decreases levels of lurasidone by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Contraindicated; decreases lurasidone Cmax by ~85%.</p></li><li>mifepristone<p>mifepristone, dexamethasone. Mechanism: unknown. Contraindicated. Mfr. states that mifepristone is contraindicated in pts. on long term corticosteroid Tx.</p></li><li>naloxegol<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of naloxegol by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated.  Use of naloxegol with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended</p></li><li>ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Technivie is contraindicated with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers.</p></li><li>ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir &amp; dasabuvir<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir &amp; dasabuvir by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Strong CYP3A4 inducers may reduce partiaprevir and ritonavir levels, and therefore decreased efficacy of Viekira Pak</p></li><li>panobinostat<p>dexamethasone decreases levels of panobinostat by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Strong CYP3A4 inducers can reduce panobinostat levels by ~70% and lead to treatment failure.</p></li><li>praziquantel<p>dexamethasone decreases levels of praziquantel by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Strong CYP450 inducers significantly decrease praziquantel blood levels.</p></li><li>regorafenib<p>dexamethasone, regorafenib. affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease regorafenib levels and increase exposure of the active metabolite M-5.</p></li><li>rilpivirine<p>dexamethasone decreases levels of rilpivirine by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Contraindicated. Rilpivirine should not be co-administered with strong CYP 3A4 inducers. Potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the NNRTI class.</p></li><li>roflumilast<p>dexamethasone will decrease the level or effect of roflumilast by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Coadministration not recommended; strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers decrease systemic exposure to roflumilast and may reduce the therapeutic effectiveness</p></li><li>vandetanib<p>dexamethasone decreases levels of vandetanib by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Avoid coadministration with potent CYP3A4 inducers; these drugs reduce exposure to vandetanib by up to 40%.</p></li>
