<li>acitretin<p>acitretin decreases effects of medroxyprogesterone by unknown mechanism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Contraceptive failure may result.</p></li><li>darunavir<p>darunavir will decrease the level or effect of medroxyprogesterone by  unspecified interaction mechanism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Oral formulation only</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of medroxyprogesterone by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of medroxyprogesterone by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to 3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>lesinurad<p>lesinurad decreases effects of medroxyprogesterone by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Use additional methods of nonhormonal contraception. Do not rely on hormonal contraception alone when taking lesinurad.</p></li><li>nelfinavir<p>nelfinavir will increase the level or effect of medroxyprogesterone by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ritonavir<p>ritonavir will increase the level or effect of medroxyprogesterone by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>saquinavir<p>saquinavir will increase the level or effect of medroxyprogesterone by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>sugammadex sodium<p>sugammadex sodium decreases effects of medroxyprogesterone by receptor binding competition. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. In vitro binding studies showed that sugammadex may bind to progestogen, thereby decreasing progestogen exposure. Therefore, a sugammadex bolus dose is considered to be equivalent to missing dose(s) of hormonal contraceptives containing an estrogen or progestogen. If an oral contraceptive is taken on the same day of sugammadex, or the patient has a transdermal or implant hormonal contraceptive, the patient must use an additional, nonhormonal contraceptive method or back-up method of contraception (eg, condoms and spermicides) for the next 7 days.</p></li><li>telithromycin<p>telithromycin will increase the level or effect of medroxyprogesterone by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>voriconazole<p>voriconazole will increase the level or effect of medroxyprogesterone by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li>
