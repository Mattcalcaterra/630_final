Comment: rhPTH causes transient increase in calcium and therefore, concomitant use with cardiac glycosides may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy is reduced if hypocalcemia is present. If coadministered, carefully monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels, and patients for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.
