Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>irinotecan liposomal<p>modafinil will decrease the level or effect of irinotecan liposomal by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor, modafinil.
Either increases levels of the other by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to CYP3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>lovastatin<p>modafinil will decrease the level or effect of lovastatin by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism.
