<li>axitinib<p>acetaminophen increases levels of axitinib by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>busulfan<p>acetaminophen increases levels of busulfan by decreasing metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Use of acetaminophen prior to (&lt; 72 hours) or concurrently with busulfan may result in decreased clearance of busulfan due to acetaminophen-induced decreases in glutathione levels.</p></li><li>daclizumab<p>daclizumab, acetaminophen. Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Caution should be used if hepatotoxic drugs are coadministered, including nonprescription drugs. .</p></li><li>dapsone topical<p>acetaminophen increases toxicity of dapsone topical by altering metabolism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. May induce methemoglobinemia .</p></li><li>eltrombopag<p>eltrombopag increases levels of acetaminophen by decreasing metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. UGT inhibition; significance of interaction unclear.</p></li><li>exenatide injectable solution<p>exenatide injectable solution will decrease the level or effect of acetaminophen by  unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. To avoid potential interaction, give acetaminophen at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after exenatide injection.</p></li><li>exenatide injectable suspension<p>exenatide injectable suspension will decrease the level or effect of acetaminophen by  unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. To avoid potential interaction, give acetaminophen at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after exenatide injection.</p></li><li>flibanserin<p>acetaminophen will increase the level or effect of flibanserin by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Increased flibanserin adverse effects may occur if coadministered with multiple weak CYP3A4 inhibitors.</p></li><li>imatinib<p>imatinib decreases levels of acetaminophen by decreasing hepatic clearance. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. In vitro, imatinib was found to inhibit acetaminophen O-glucuronidation (Ki value of 58.5 micro-M) at therapeutic levels; avoid chronic acetaminophen therapy with imatinib; if occasional acetaminophen administered, do not exceed 1300 mg/day.</p></li><li>isoniazid<p>isoniazid will increase the level or effect of acetaminophen by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2E1 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>acetaminophen increases levels of ivacaftor by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Monitor when coadministered with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors .</p></li><li>lixisenatide<p>lixisenatide will decrease the level or effect of acetaminophen by  inhibition of GI absorption. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. GLP1 agonists delay gastric emptying, which may affect absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. No effects on acetaminophen Cmax and Tmax were observed when acetaminophen was administered 1 hr before lixisenatide. When administered 1 or 4 hr after lixisenatide, acetaminophen Cmax was decreased by 29% and 31% respectively and median Tmax was delayed by 2 and 1.75 hr, respectively.</p></li><li>lomitapide<p>acetaminophen increases levels of lomitapide by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Lomitapide dose should not exceed 30 mg/day.</p></li><li>mipomersen<p>mipomersen, acetaminophen.
Either increases toxicity of the other by Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Both drugs have potential to increase hepatic enzymes; monitor LFTs.</p></li><li>tetracaine<p>tetracaine, acetaminophen. Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Monitor for signs of methemoglobinemia when methemoglobin-inducing drugs are coadministered.</p></li><li>warfarin<p>acetaminophen increases effects of warfarin by unknown mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li>
