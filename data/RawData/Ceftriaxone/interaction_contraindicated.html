Comment: Contraindicated in neonates if they require (or are expected to require) treatment with calcium containing IV solutions, including continuous calcium containing infusions such as parenteral nutrition because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone and calcium. Separate IV ceftriaxone and IV calcium by at least 48 hrs. However, in patients other than neonates, ceftriaxone and calcium containing solutions may be administered sequentially of one another if the IV infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid.</p></li><li>calcium citrate<p>ceftriaxone, calcium citrate.
