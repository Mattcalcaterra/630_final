<li>atorvastatin<p>fenofibrate, atorvastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>colchicine<p>colchicine, fenofibrate.
Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Increased risk of rhabdomyolysis (incl a fatality).</p></li><li>fluvastatin<p>fenofibrate, fluvastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of fenofibrate by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of fenofibrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to 3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>lovastatin<p>fenofibrate, lovastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.

Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>pravastatin<p>fenofibrate, pravastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>rosuvastatin<p>fenofibrate, rosuvastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>simvastatin<p>fenofibrate, simvastatin.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Fenofibrate may further increase risk for rhabdomyolysis when added to optimal statin regimen to further decrease TG and increase HDLs.</p></li><li>warfarin<p>fenofibrate increases effects of warfarin by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.<span><br><br></span>fenofibrate increases effects of warfarin by plasma protein binding competition. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li>
