<li>chlorpropamide<p>fenofibrate increases effects of chlorpropamide by plasma protein binding competition. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>cholestyramine<p>cholestyramine decreases levels of fenofibrate by inhibition of GI absorption. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>cholic acid<p>fenofibrate increases toxicity of cholic acid by decreasing elimination. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. Avoid concomitant use of inhibitors of the bile salt efflux pump (BSEP). May exacerbate accumulation of conjugated bile salts in the liver and result in clinical symptoms. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin.</p></li><li>crofelemer<p>crofelemer increases levels of fenofibrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Crofelemer has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 at concentrations expected in the gut; unlikely to inhibit systemically because minimally absorbed.</p></li><li>dabrafenib<p>dabrafenib will decrease the level or effect of fenofibrate by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely.</p></li><li>daclizumab<p>daclizumab, fenofibrate. Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Caution should be used if hepatotoxic drugs are coadministered, including nonprescription drugs. Both drugs reported to cause autoimmune hepatitis.</p></li><li>elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir df<p>elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir df increases levels of fenofibrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. Cobicistat is a CYP3A4 inhibitor; contraindicated with CYP3A4 substrates for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events.</p></li><li>glimepiride<p>fenofibrate increases effects of glimepiride by plasma protein binding competition. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>glipizide<p>fenofibrate increases effects of glipizide by plasma protein binding competition. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>gliquidone<p>fenofibrate increases effects of gliquidone by plasma protein binding competition. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>glyburide<p>fenofibrate increases effects of glyburide by plasma protein binding competition. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>iloperidone<p>iloperidone increases levels of fenofibrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Iloperidone is a time-dependent CYP3A inhibitor and may lead to increased plasma levels of drugs predominantly eliminated by CYP3A4.</p></li><li>insulin aspart<p>fenofibrate increases effects of insulin aspart by unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>insulin degludec<p>fenofibrate, insulin degludec.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Use Caution/Monitor. Both drugs decrease blood glucose.</p></li><li>insulin degludec/insulin aspart<p>fenofibrate, insulin degludec/insulin aspart.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Use Caution/Monitor. Both drugs decrease blood glucose.</p></li><li>insulin detemir<p>fenofibrate increases effects of insulin detemir by unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>insulin glargine<p>fenofibrate increases effects of insulin glargine by unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>insulin glulisine<p>fenofibrate increases effects of insulin glulisine by unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>insulin inhaled<p>fenofibrate, insulin inhaled.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Use Caution/Monitor. Both drugs decrease blood glucose.</p></li><li>insulin lispro<p>fenofibrate increases effects of insulin lispro by unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>insulin nph<p>fenofibrate increases effects of insulin nph by unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>insulin regular human<p>fenofibrate increases effects of insulin regular human by unspecified interaction mechanism. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>mitotane<p>mitotane decreases levels of fenofibrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Mitotane is a strong inducer of cytochrome P-4503A4; monitor when coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates for possible dosage adjustments.</p></li><li>tenofovir df<p>fenofibrate increases levels of tenofovir df by decreasing renal clearance. Use Caution/Monitor. Increased risk of myopathy.</p></li><li>tolazamide<p>fenofibrate increases effects of tolazamide by plasma protein binding competition. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li><li>tolbutamide<p>fenofibrate increases effects of tolbutamide by plasma protein binding competition. Use Caution/Monitor. Hypoglycemia; increased risk in hypoalbuminemia.</p></li>
