<li>atazanavir<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of atazanavir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Substantially reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if PPIs are coadministered. PPI dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken ~12 h before atazanavir/ritonavir in treatment naive-patients. PPIs are not recommended in treatment-experienced taking atazanavir.</p></li><li>dapsone<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of dapsone by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>dasatinib<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of dasatinib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>delavirdine<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of delavirdine by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>digoxin<p>lansoprazole will increase the level or effect of digoxin by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of lansoprazole by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>indinavir<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of indinavir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>itraconazole<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of itraconazole by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ketoconazole<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of ketoconazole by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>mesalamine<p>lansoprazole decreases effects of mesalamine by increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Applies only to sustained release dosage form.</p></li><li>nilotinib<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of nilotinib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Nilotinib has a pH-dependent solubility and  solubility is decreased at higher pH; separating doses may not eliminate this effect because of PPI extended duration of action</p></li><li>nisoldipine<p>lansoprazole will increase the level or effect of nisoldipine by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>pazopanib<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of pazopanib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Avoid coadministration of pazopanib with drugs that raise gastric pH; consider short-acting antacids in place of PPIs and H2 antagonists; separate antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours</p></li><li>phenytoin<p>phenytoin will decrease the level or effect of lansoprazole by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Consider alternative for one of the interacting drugs<span><br><br></span>phenytoin will decrease the level or effect of lansoprazole by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Consider alternative for one of the interacting drugs</p></li><li>ponatinib<p>lansoprazole decreases levels of ponatinib by increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>sofosbuvir/velpatasvir<p>lansoprazole will decrease the level or effect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Velpatasvir solubility decreases as gastric pH increases (practically insoluble at pH &gt;5). Coadministration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with omeprazole or other PPIs is not recommended. If considered medically necessary, give sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with food 4 hr before omeprazole 20 mg. Use with other PPIs has not been studied.</p></li>
