<li>diltiazem<p>diltiazem will increase the level or effect of amlodipine by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Diltiazem increases amlodipine exposure by 60%; avoid use if possible</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of amlodipine by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor, amlodipine.
Either increases levels of the other by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to CYP3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>nefazodone<p>nefazodone will increase the level or effect of amlodipine by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>simvastatin<p>amlodipine increases levels of simvastatin by Other (see comment). Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. 
Comment: Benefits of combination therapy should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of combination. Potential for increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. Limit simvastatin dose to no more than 20 mg/day when used concurrently.</p></li>
