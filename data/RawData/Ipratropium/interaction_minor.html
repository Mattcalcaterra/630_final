Comment: Anticholinergic agents may enhance the therapeutic effects of levodopa; however, anticholinergic agents can exacerbate tardive dyskinesia. In high dosage, anticholinergics may decrease the effects of levodopa by delaying its GI absorption. .</p></li><li>tacrine<p>tacrine decreases effects of ipratropium by pharmacodynamic antagonism.
