<li>eluxadoline<p>loperamide, eluxadoline.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Avoid coadministration with other drugs that cause constipation. Increases risk for constipation related serious adverse reactions. Loperamide may be used occasionally for acute management of severe diarrhea but avoid chronic use. Discontinue loperamide immediately if constipation occurs.</p></li><li>fentanyl<p>fentanyl, loperamide.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>fentanyl intranasal<p>fentanyl intranasal, loperamide.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system<p>fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system, loperamide.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>fentanyl transdermal<p>fentanyl transdermal, loperamide.

Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of loperamide by P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit P-gp, may significantly increase systemic exposure to P-gp substrates.</p></li><li>quinidine<p>quinidine will increase the level or effect of loperamide by  P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li>
