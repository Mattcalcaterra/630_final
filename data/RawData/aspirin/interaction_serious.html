The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>ibuprofen<p>ibuprofen decreases effects of aspirin by Other (see comment). Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. 
Comment: Ibuprofen decreases the antiplatelet effects of low-dose aspirin by blocking the active site of platelet cyclooxygenase. Administer ibuprofen 8 h before aspirin or at least 2-4 h after aspirin. The effect of other NSAIDs on aspirin is not established.</p></li><li>ketorolac<p>aspirin, ketorolac.
Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated.</p></li><li>ketorolac intranasal<p>aspirin, ketorolac intranasal.
Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated.</p></li><li>lesinurad<p>aspirin decreases effects of lesinurad by unspecified interaction mechanism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Aspirin at doses &gt;325 mg/day may decrease lesinurad efficacy. Aspirin doses 325 mg/day or less (ie, for cardiovascular event prophylaxis) does not decrease lesinurad efficacy and can be coadministered.</p></li><li>lisinopril<p>aspirin, lisinopril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, live<p>aspirin, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, live. Mechanism: unspecified interaction mechanism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of Reye's Syndrome with combination; avoid salicylate use for 6 wks after vaccination.</p></li><li>methotrexate<p>aspirin increases levels of methotrexate by decreasing renal clearance. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Caution should be exercised when salicylates are given in combination with methotrexate.  Risk for drug interactions with methotrexate is greatest during high-dose methotrexate therapy, it has been recommended that any of these drugs be used cautiously with methotrexate even when methotrexate is used in low doses.</p></li><li>moexipril<p>aspirin, moexipril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>pemetrexed<p>aspirin increases levels of pemetrexed by unspecified interaction mechanism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Interrupt dosing in all patients taking NSAIDs with long elimination half-lives for at least 5d before, the day of, and 2d following pemetrexed administration. If coadministration of an NSAID is necessary, closely monitor patients for toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal toxicity, and GI toxicity.</p></li><li>perindopril<p>aspirin, perindopril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>probenecid<p>aspirin decreases effects of probenecid by acidic (anionic) drug competition for renal tubular clearance. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Aspirin decreases uricosuric action of probenecid.</p></li><li>quinapril<p>aspirin, quinapril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>ramipril<p>aspirin, ramipril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>ticlopidine<p>aspirin increases effects of ticlopidine by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Enhanced risk of hemorrhage.</p></li><li>trandolapril<p>aspirin, trandolapril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.
