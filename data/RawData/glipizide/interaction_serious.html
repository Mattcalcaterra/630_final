<li>aminolevulinic acid<p>glipizide increases toxicity of aminolevulinic acid by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration of photosensitizing drugs may enhance the phototoxic reaction to photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid.</p></li><li>ethanol<p>ethanol, glipizide. Other (see comment). Contraindicated. 
Comment: Excessive EtOH consumption may alter glycemic control.  Some sulfonylureas may produce a disulfiram like rxn.</p></li><li>lumacaftor/ivacaftor<p>lumacaftor/ivacaftor will decrease the level or effect of glipizide by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C9/10 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Sulfonylureas are CYP2C9 substrates. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2C9.</p></li><li>methyl aminolevulinate<p>glipizide increases toxicity of methyl aminolevulinate by pharmacodynamic synergism.
