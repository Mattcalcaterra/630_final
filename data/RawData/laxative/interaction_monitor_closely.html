<li>amphetamine<p>sodium acid phosphate decreases levels of amphetamine by passive renal tubular reabsorption due to decreased pH. Use Caution/Monitor. Basic amphetamine molecule is ionized by acidic pH, thus preventing renal tubular reabsorption.</p></li><li>deflazacort<p>sodium acid phosphate and deflazacort both decrease  serum potassium. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>dextroamphetamine<p>sodium acid phosphate decreases levels of dextroamphetamine by increasing renal clearance. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>lisdexamfetamine<p>sodium acid phosphate decreases levels of lisdexamfetamine by increasing renal clearance. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>methamphetamine<p>sodium acid phosphate decreases levels of methamphetamine by increasing renal clearance. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>methylenedioxymethamphetamine<p>sodium acid phosphate decreases levels of methylenedioxymethamphetamine by increasing renal clearance. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li>
