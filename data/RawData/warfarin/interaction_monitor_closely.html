Comment: Corticosteroids may decrease anticoagulant effects by increasing blood coagulability; conversely, they may impair vascular integrity, thus increasing bleeding risk.  Monitor INR closely.</p></li><li>triclofos<p>triclofos increases effects of warfarin by unspecified interaction mechanism.

Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>vemurafenib<p>vemurafenib will increase the level or effect of warfarin by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C9/10 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Exercise caution and consider additional INR monitoring when vemurafenib is used concomitantly with warfarin. </p></li><li>venetoclax<p>venetoclax increases effects of warfarin by unknown mechanism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. In a drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, administration of a single dose of venetoclax with warfarin resulted in an 18-28% increase in Cmax and AUC of R-warfarin and S-warfarin. Because venetoclax was not dosed to steady state, it is recommended that the INR be monitored closely in patients receiving warfarin. .</p></li><li>verapamil<p>verapamil will increase the level or effect of warfarin by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP1A2 metabolism.
