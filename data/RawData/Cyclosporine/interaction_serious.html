Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>topotecan<p>cyclosporine will increase the level or effect of topotecan by  P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Product labeling for PO topotecan recommends avoiding concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors; the interaction with IV topotecan may be less severe but is still likely of clinical significance. Additionally, topotecan is a substrate of the BCRP efflux transporter. Cylcosporine also inhibits BCRP.</p></li><li>travelers diarrhea and cholera vaccine inactivated<p>cyclosporine decreases effects of travelers diarrhea and cholera vaccine inactivated by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Contraindicated. Immunosuppressants also increase risk of infection with concomitant live vaccines.</p></li><li>triamterene<p>triamterene and cyclosporine both increase  serum potassium.

Monitor more closely for signs of venetoclax toxicities.<span><br><br></span>venetoclax will increase the level or effect of cyclosporine by  P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. In vitro data suggest venetoclax may inhibit P-gp substrates at therapeutic dose levels in the gut. Avoid coadministration of narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates with venetoclax. If a narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrate must be used, it should be taken at least 6 hr before venetoclax.</p></li><li>yellow fever vaccine<p>cyclosporine decreases effects of yellow fever vaccine by pharmacodynamic antagonism.
