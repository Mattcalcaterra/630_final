<li>cisapride<p>mirtazapine increases toxicity of cisapride by unspecified interaction mechanism. Contraindicated. Risk of prolonged QTc interval.</p></li><li>clonidine<p>mirtazapine decreases effects of clonidine by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of hypertensive urgency.</p></li><li>cyclobenzaprine<p>mirtazapine and cyclobenzaprine both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>desvenlafaxine<p>mirtazapine and desvenlafaxine both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>guanabenz<p>mirtazapine decreases effects of guanabenz by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of hypertensive urgency.</p></li><li>guanfacine<p>mirtazapine decreases effects of guanfacine by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Risk of hypertensive urgency.</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of mirtazapine by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>isocarboxazid<p>isocarboxazid and mirtazapine both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor, mirtazapine.
Either increases levels of the other by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to CYP3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>linezolid<p>linezolid and mirtazapine both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Linezolid may increase serotonin as a result of MAO-A inhibition. If linezolid must be administered, discontinue serotonergic drug immediately and monitor for CNS toxicity. Serotonergic therapy may be resumed 24 hours after last linezolid dose or after 2 weeks of monitoring, whichever comes first.</p></li><li>lorcaserin<p>mirtazapine and lorcaserin both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>mefloquine<p>mefloquine increases toxicity of mirtazapine by QTc interval. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Mefloquine may enhance the QTc prolonging effect of high risk QTc prolonging agents.</p></li><li>methylene blue<p>methylene blue and mirtazapine both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Methylene blue may increase serotonin as a result of MAO-A inhibition. If methylene blue must be administered, discontinue serotonergic drug immediately and monitor for CNS toxicity. Serotonergic therapy may be resumed 24 hours after last methylene blue dose or after 2 weeks of monitoring, whichever comes first.</p></li><li>phenelzine<p>phenelzine and mirtazapine both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>sodium oxybate<p>mirtazapine, sodium oxybate.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated. Additive CNS depression.</p></li><li>tedizolid<p>tedizolid, mirtazapine.
Either increases effects of the other by Mechanism: pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. both increase serotonin levels; increased risk of serotonin syndrome.</p></li><li>tranylcypromine<p>tranylcypromine and mirtazapine both increase  serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>vilazodone<p>mirtazapine, vilazodone.
Either increases toxicity of the other by serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Concomitant therapy should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome emerge and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.  .</p></li><li>vortioxetine<p>mirtazapine increases toxicity of vortioxetine by serotonin levels. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li>
