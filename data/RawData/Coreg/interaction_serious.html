Coadministration of riociguat (substrate of CYP isoenzymes 1A1, 2C8, 3A, 2J2) with strong CYP inhibitors may require a decreased initial dose of 0.5 mg PO TID; monitor for signs of hypotension and reduce dose if needed</p></li><li>sotalol<p>carvedilol and sotalol both increase  anti-hypertensive channel blocking. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>thioridazine<p>carvedilol, thioridazine.
Either increases levels of the other by decreasing metabolism. Contraindicated. Not all beta blockers share this interaction (e.g., atenolol, nadolol, sotalol do not interact).</p></li><li>thiothixene<p>carvedilol, thiothixene.
