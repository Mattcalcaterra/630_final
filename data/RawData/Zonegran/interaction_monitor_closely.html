Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>erythromycin stearate<p>erythromycin stearate will increase the level or effect of zonisamide by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>fluvoxamine<p>fluvoxamine will increase the level or effect of zonisamide by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>iloperidone<p>iloperidone increases levels of zonisamide by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Iloperidone is a time-dependent CYP3A inhibitor and may lead to increased plasma levels of drugs predominantly eliminated by CYP3A4.</p></li><li>isoniazid<p>isoniazid will increase the level or effect of zonisamide by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>itraconazole<p>itraconazole will increase the level or effect of zonisamide by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>ketoconazole<p>ketoconazole will increase the level or effect of zonisamide by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>lurasidone<p>lurasidone, zonisamide.
Either increases toxicity of the other by Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Potential for increased CNS depressant effects when used concurrently; monitor for increased adverse effects and toxicity.</p></li><li>metformin<p>zonisamide increases toxicity of metformin by Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Decreases serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.</p></li><li>mitotane<p>mitotane decreases levels of zonisamide by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Mitotane is a strong inducer of cytochrome P-4503A4; monitor when coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates for possible dosage adjustments.</p></li><li>orlistat<p>orlistat decreases levels of zonisamide by inhibition of GI absorption. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. Risk of convulsions.</p></li><li>rifabutin<p>rifabutin will decrease the level or effect of zonisamide by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism.
