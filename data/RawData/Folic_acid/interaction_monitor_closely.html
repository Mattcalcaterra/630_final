<li>glucarpidase<p>glucarpidase will decrease the level or effect of folic acid by  increasing metabolism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. Leucorvorin, reduced folates, and folate antimetabolites are substrates for glucarpidase (hydrolyzes glutamate residue from folic acid and antifolates)</p></li><li>green tea<p>green tea, folic acid. Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Concomitant consumption of green tea with folic acid is not recommended in pregnant women, megaloblastic anemia, or when a reduction in folic acid may have clinical consequences. A folate transporter interaction has been described, leading to decreases in bioavailability of folic acid.</p></li><li>pancrelipase<p>pancrelipase decreases levels of folic acid by inhibition of GI absorption. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Use Caution/Monitor. folic deficiency may occur.</p></li><li>pyrimethamine<p>folic acid, pyrimethamine.
Either decreases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic antagonism. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li>
