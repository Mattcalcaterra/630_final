<li>atazanavir<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of atazanavir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Substantially reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if PPIs are coadministered. PPI dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken ~12 h before atazanavir/ritonavir in treatment naive-patients. PPIs are not recommended in treatment-experienced taking atazanavir.</p></li><li>carbamazepine<p>carbamazepine will decrease the level or effect of esomeprazole by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ceritinib<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of ceritinib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>cilostazol<p>esomeprazole increases toxicity of cilostazol by affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Decrease cilostazol dose by 50%; 3,4-dehydrocilostazol, an active metabolite, increased by 69% as a result of omeprazole inhibition of CYP2C19.</p></li><li>clopidogrel<p>esomeprazole decreases effects of clopidogrel by affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Clopidogrel efficacy may be reduced by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. Clopidogrel is metabolized to this active metabolite in part by CYP2C19.  .</p></li><li>dasatinib<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of dasatinib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>delavirdine<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of delavirdine by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>digoxin<p>esomeprazole will increase the level or effect of digoxin by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>fluvoxamine<p>fluvoxamine will increase the level or effect of esomeprazole by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of esomeprazole by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>indinavir<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of indinavir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>isoniazid<p>isoniazid will increase the level or effect of esomeprazole by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>itraconazole<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of itraconazole by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of esomeprazole by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to   3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>ketoconazole<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of ketoconazole by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>mesalamine<p>esomeprazole decreases effects of mesalamine by increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Applies only to sustained release dosage form.</p></li><li>nilotinib<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of nilotinib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Nilotinib has a pH-dependent solubility and  solubility is decreased at higher pH; separating doses may not eliminate this effect because of PPI extended duration of action</p></li><li>nisoldipine<p>esomeprazole will increase the level or effect of nisoldipine by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>pazopanib<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of pazopanib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Avoid coadministration of pazopanib with drugs that raise gastric pH; consider short-acting antacids in place of PPIs and H2 antagonists; separate antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours</p></li><li>ponatinib<p>esomeprazole decreases levels of ponatinib by increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>sofosbuvir/velpatasvir<p>esomeprazole will decrease the level or effect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Velpatasvir solubility decreases as gastric pH increases (practically insoluble at pH &gt;5). Coadministration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with omeprazole or other PPIs is not recommended. If considered medically necessary, give sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with food 4 hr before omeprazole 20 mg. Use with other PPIs has not been studied.</p></li>
