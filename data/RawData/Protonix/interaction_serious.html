<li>afatinib<p>pantoprazole increases levels of afatinib by P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Reduce afatinib daily dose by 10 mg if not tolerated when coadministered with P-gp inhibitors.</p></li><li>atazanavir<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of atazanavir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Substantially reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if PPIs are coadministered. PPI dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken ~12 h before atazanavir/ritonavir in treatment naive-patients. PPIs are not recommended in treatment-experienced taking atazanavir.</p></li><li>dasatinib<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of dasatinib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>delavirdine<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of delavirdine by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>digoxin<p>pantoprazole will increase the level or effect of digoxin by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>edoxaban<p>pantoprazole will increase the level or effect of edoxaban by  P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Dose adjustment may be required with strong P-gp inhibitors. DVT/PE treatment: Decrease dose to 30 mg PO once daily. NVAF: No dose reduction recommended</p></li><li>indinavir<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of indinavir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>itraconazole<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of itraconazole by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of pantoprazole by P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit P-gp, may significantly increase systemic exposure to P-gp substrates.</p></li><li>ketoconazole<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of ketoconazole by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>mesalamine<p>pantoprazole decreases effects of mesalamine by increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Applies only to sustained release dosage form.</p></li><li>nilotinib<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of nilotinib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Nilotinib has a pH-dependent solubility and  solubility is decreased at higher pH; separating doses may not eliminate this effect because of PPI extended duration of action</p></li><li>nisoldipine<p>pantoprazole will increase the level or effect of nisoldipine by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>pazopanib<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of pazopanib by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Avoid coadministration of pazopanib with drugs that raise gastric pH; consider short-acting antacids in place of PPIs and H2 antagonists; separate antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours</p></li><li>pomalidomide<p>pantoprazole increases levels of pomalidomide by P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ponatinib<p>pantoprazole decreases levels of ponatinib by increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>riociguat<p>pantoprazole will increase the level or effect of riociguat by  decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration of riociguat (substrate of CYP isoenzymes 1A1, 2C8, 3A, 2J2) with strong CYP inhibitors may require a decreased initial dose of 0.5 mg PO TID; monitor for signs of hypotension and reduce dose if needed<span><br><br></span>pantoprazole will increase the level or effect of riociguat by  P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration of riociguat (P-gp substrate) with strong P-gp inhibitors may require a decreased initial dose of 0.5 mg PO TID; monitor for signs of hypotension and reduce dose if needed</p></li><li>sofosbuvir/velpatasvir<p>pantoprazole will decrease the level or effect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Velpatasvir solubility decreases as gastric pH increases (practically insoluble at pH &gt;5). Coadministration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with omeprazole or other PPIs is not recommended. If considered medically necessary, give sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with food 4 hr before omeprazole 20 mg. Use with other PPIs has not been studied.</p></li><li>venetoclax<p>pantoprazole will increase the level or effect of venetoclax by  P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If a P-gp inhibitor must be used, reduce the venetoclax dose by at least 50%. Monitor more closely for signs of venetoclax toxicities.</p></li>
