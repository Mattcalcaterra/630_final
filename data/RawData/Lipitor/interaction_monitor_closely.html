Comment: Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1 transporters. Coadministration may increase systemic exposure of drugs that are substrates of these transporters. Coadministration may significantly increase atorvastatin serum concentration, which is associated with increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.</p></li><li>spironolactone<p>spironolactone will increase the level or effect of atorvastatin by  P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter.
