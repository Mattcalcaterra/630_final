Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated. May increase creatine kinase levels and increase risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis; red yeast rice contains monocolin K (reportedly identical to lovastatin).</p></li><li>telaprevir<p>telaprevir increases levels of atorvastatin by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Contraindicated. Potential for myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.</p></li><li>tipranavir<p>tipranavir increases levels of atorvastatin by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. This interaction is the net effect of tipranavir being coadministered with ritonavir (boosted therapy); increased risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.</p></li>
