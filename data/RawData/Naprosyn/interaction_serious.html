<li>benazepril<p>naproxen, benazepril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>captopril<p>naproxen, captopril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>enalapril<p>naproxen, enalapril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>fosinopril<p>naproxen, fosinopril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>ketorolac<p>naproxen, ketorolac.
Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated.</p></li><li>ketorolac intranasal<p>naproxen, ketorolac intranasal.
Either increases toxicity of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated.</p></li><li>lisinopril<p>naproxen, lisinopril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>methotrexate<p>naproxen increases levels of methotrexate by decreasing renal clearance. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Concomitant administration of NSAIDs with high dose methotrexate has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and GI toxicity. NSAIDs may reduce tubular secretion of methotrexate and enhance toxicity.</p></li><li>moexipril<p>naproxen, moexipril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>pemetrexed<p>naproxen increases levels of pemetrexed by unspecified interaction mechanism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Interrupt dosing in all patients taking NSAIDs with long elimination half-lives for at least 5d before, the day of, and 2d following pemetrexed administration. If coadministration of an NSAID is necessary, closely monitor patients for toxicity, especially myelosuppression, renal toxicity, and GI toxicity.</p></li><li>perindopril<p>naproxen, perindopril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>quinapril<p>naproxen, quinapril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>ramipril<p>naproxen, ramipril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li><li>tacrolimus<p>naproxen, tacrolimus.
Either increases toxicity of the other by Other (see comment). Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. 
Comment: Concomitant administration increases risk of nephrotoxicity.</p></li><li>trandolapril<p>naproxen, trandolapril. pharmacodynamic antagonism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration may result in a significant decrease in renal function. NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. The mechanism of these interactions is likely related to the ability of NSAIDs to reduce the synthesis of vasodilating renal prostaglandins.</p></li>
