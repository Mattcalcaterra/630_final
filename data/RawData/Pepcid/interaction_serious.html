<li>atazanavir<p>famotidine will decrease the level or effect of atazanavir by  increasing gastric pH. Applies only to oral form of both agents. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Substantially reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) are coadministered. For treatment-na√Øve patients, take atazanavir simultaneously with the H2RA or at least 10 h afterwards. See dosage adjustment recommendations if coadministered in treatment-experienced patients.</p></li><li>bosutinib<p>famotidine will decrease the level or effect of bosutinib by  increasing gastric pH.
