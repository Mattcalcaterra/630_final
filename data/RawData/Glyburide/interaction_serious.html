<li>aminolevulinic acid<p>glyburide increases toxicity of aminolevulinic acid by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration of photosensitizing drugs may enhance the phototoxic reaction to photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid.</p></li><li>eluxadoline<p>glyburide increases levels of eluxadoline by decreasing metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Decrease eluxadoline dose to 75 mg PO BID if coadministered with OATP1B1 inhibitors. .</p></li><li>ethanol<p>ethanol, glyburide. Other (see comment). Contraindicated. 
Comment: Excessive EtOH consumption may alter glycemic control.  Some sulfonylureas may produce a disulfiram like rxn.</p></li><li>fluvastatin<p>fluvastatin increases levels of glyburide by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of glyburide by P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit P-gp, may significantly increase systemic exposure to P-gp substrates.</p></li><li>lumacaftor/ivacaftor<p>lumacaftor/ivacaftor will decrease the level or effect of glyburide by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2C9/10 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Sulfonylureas are CYP2C9 substrates. Lumacaftor/ivacaftor has the potential to induce CYP2C9.</p></li><li>methyl aminolevulinate<p>glyburide increases toxicity of methyl aminolevulinate by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration of photosensitizing drugs may enhance the phototoxic reaction to photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid.</p></li>
