<li>arginine<p>isosorbide mononitrate, arginine. Mechanism: additive vasodilation. Use Caution/Monitor. Possible hypotension.</p></li><li>captopril<p>isosorbide mononitrate, captopril.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Use Caution/Monitor. Both drugs lower blood pressure. Monitor blood pressure.</p></li><li>crofelemer<p>crofelemer increases levels of isosorbide mononitrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Crofelemer has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 at concentrations expected in the gut; unlikely to inhibit systemically because minimally absorbed.</p></li><li>dabrafenib<p>dabrafenib will decrease the level or effect of isosorbide mononitrate by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely.</p></li><li>dapsone topical<p>isosorbide mononitrate increases toxicity of dapsone topical by altering metabolism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. May induce methemoglobinemia.</p></li><li>dichlorphenamide<p>dichlorphenamide and isosorbide mononitrate both decrease  serum potassium. Use Caution/Monitor.</p></li><li>elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir df<p>elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir df increases levels of isosorbide mononitrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Modify Therapy/Monitor Closely. Cobicistat is a CYP3A4 inhibitor; contraindicated with CYP3A4 substrates for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events.</p></li><li>iloperidone<p>iloperidone increases levels of isosorbide mononitrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Iloperidone is a time-dependent CYP3A inhibitor and may lead to increased plasma levels of drugs predominantly eliminated by CYP3A4.</p></li><li>maraviroc<p>maraviroc, isosorbide mononitrate.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Use Caution/Monitor. Increased risk of orthostatic hypotension.</p></li><li>mitotane<p>mitotane decreases levels of isosorbide mononitrate by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Mitotane is a strong inducer of cytochrome P-4503A4; monitor when coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates for possible dosage adjustments.</p></li><li>nitroglycerin rectal<p>nitroglycerin rectal, isosorbide mononitrate.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Use Caution/Monitor. Observe for possible additive hypotensive effects during concomitant use. .</p></li><li>tetracaine<p>tetracaine, isosorbide mononitrate. Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Monitor for signs of methemoglobinemia when methemoglobin-inducing drugs are coadministered.</p></li>
