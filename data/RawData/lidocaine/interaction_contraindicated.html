<li>bupivacaine liposome<p>lidocaine increases toxicity of bupivacaine liposome by Other (see comment). Contraindicated. 
Comment: Do not admix with other local nonbupivacaine-based local anesthetics; admixing results in a rapid increase in free (unencapsulated) bupivacaine; may administer after waiting at least 20 minutes following local administration of lidocaine.</p></li><li>dofetilide<p>lidocaine increases effects of dofetilide by pharmacodynamic synergism. Contraindicated. Additive cardiac effects.</p></li><li>eliglustat<p>lidocaine increases levels of eliglustat by affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 metabolism. Contraindicated. If coadministered with strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors, reduce eliglustat dose from 84 mg BID to 84 mg once daily in extensive  and intermediate metabolizers;  eliglustat is contraindiated if strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors are given concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors.</p></li><li>flibanserin<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of flibanserin by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated. Coadministration of flibanserin with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Severe hypotension or syncope can occur.</p></li><li>lomitapide<p>lidocaine increases levels of lomitapide by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Contraindicated.
