Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If coadministration of CYP3A4  inhibitors with fentanyl is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider fentanyl dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved.</p></li><li>fentanyl intranasal<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of fentanyl intranasal by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If coadministration of CYP3A4  inhibitors with fentanyl is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider fentanyl dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved.</p></li><li>fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If coadministration of CYP3A4  inhibitors with fentanyl is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider fentanyl dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved.</p></li><li>fentanyl transdermal<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of fentanyl transdermal by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If coadministration of CYP3A4  inhibitors with fentanyl is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider fentanyl dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved.</p></li><li>fentanyl transmucosal<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of fentanyl transmucosal by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If coadministration of CYP3A4  inhibitors with fentanyl is necessary, monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and consider fentanyl dose adjustments until stable drug effects are achieved.</p></li><li>fluvoxamine<p>fluvoxamine will increase the level or effect of lidocaine by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP1A2 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>fosamprenavir<p>fosamprenavir increases levels of lidocaine by unspecified interaction mechanism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>ivabradine<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of ivabradine by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Avoid coadministration of ivabradine with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of lidocaine by P-glycoprotein (MDR1) efflux transporter. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit P-gp, may significantly increase systemic exposure to P-gp substrates.</p></li><li>mefloquine<p>mefloquine increases toxicity of lidocaine by QTc interval. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Mefloquine may enhance the QTc prolonging effect of high risk QTc prolonging agents.</p></li><li>naloxegol<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of naloxegol by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If coadministation of naloxegol with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, reduce naloxegol dose to 12.5 mg qDay</p></li><li>olaparib<p>lidocaine will increase the level or effect of olaparib by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. If coadministration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce olaparib dose to 200 mg PO BID</p></li><li>pefloxacin<p>pefloxacin will increase the level or effect of lidocaine by  affecting hepatic enzyme CYP1A2 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>phenytoin<p>phenytoin decreases levels of lidocaine by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism.
