Either increases toxicity of the other by Other (see comment). Use Caution/Monitor. 
Comment: Potential for increased CNS depressant effects when used concurrently; monitor for increased adverse effects and toxicity.</p></li><li>mitotane<p>mitotane decreases levels of zolpidem by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Use Caution/Monitor. Mitotane is a strong inducer of cytochrome P-4503A4; monitor when coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates for possible dosage adjustments.</p></li><li>perphenazine<p>perphenazine will increase the level or effect of zolpidem by  pharmacodynamic synergism.
