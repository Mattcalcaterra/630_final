<li>fentanyl<p>fentanyl, zolpidem.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>fentanyl intranasal<p>fentanyl intranasal, zolpidem.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system<p>fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system, zolpidem.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>fentanyl transdermal<p>fentanyl transdermal, zolpidem.
Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects.

Either increases effects of the other by pharmacodynamic synergism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Coadministration with other CNS depressants, such as skeletal muscle relaxants, may cause respiratory depression, hypotension,  profound sedation, coma, and/or death. Consider dose reduction of either or both agents to avoid serious adverse effects. Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and profound sedation.</p></li><li>idelalisib<p>idelalisib will increase the level or effect of zolpidem by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Idelalisib is a strong CYP3A inhibitor; avoid coadministration with sensitive CYP3A substrates</p></li><li>ivacaftor<p>ivacaftor increases levels of zolpidem by affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug. Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4, may significantly increase systemic exposure to 3A4 substrates.</p></li><li>nefazodone<p>nefazodone will increase the level or effect of zolpidem by  affecting hepatic/intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 metabolism. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li><li>valerian<p>valerian and zolpidem both increase  sedation. Avoid or Use Alternate Drug.</p></li>
